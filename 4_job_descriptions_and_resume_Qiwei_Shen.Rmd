## Libraries 
Load the following libraries, you may need to install a few!

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(tidytext)
library(wordcloud2)
library(janitor)

There is a bug in wordcloud2 which prevents it from knitting more than 1 wordcloud, so we want to install wordcloud2 using devtools from github using  devtools::install_github("gaospecial/wordcloud2"). Just do this once. if you don't have devtools installed, install it first then install wordcloud2 like this.

devtools::install_github("gaospecial/wordcloud2")

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(tidytext)
library(wordcloud2)
library(janitor)

```

# Setup 

-------- 

Part 1. Analyze Jobs 

## 1. Import 

1. Create jobs dataframe by using read_excel() to read in your MSBA30-50Jobs.xlsx (after you've loaded it with jobs), you can get started by using the MSBA20JobDescription.xlsx file if you want. 
2. I recommend piping it to clean_names() to deal with column names 
3. Print the first 5 jobs to make sure your import works. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
jobs <- read_xlsx('My20JobDescriptions.xlsx')%>%
  clean_names()

head(jobs,5)

```


# Task 1 â€“ Job Description Term & Bigram Frequency Analysis 

--------

## Task 1.Create a table of term frequencies 

The following steps will help you make your  term_frequency table need to make your first wordcloud. 

0. make a vector called excludes <- this is just an exmaple c("key", "clients", "chicago")
1. pipe jobs into unnest_tokens(word, job_description)
2. pipe into anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word" = "word")) this will remove common words
3. pipe into filter(!word %in% excludes ) this will remove excluded words  
  - remove "key", "clients", "chicago" and any other words you think make sense
  
4. pipe into filter(!str_detect(word,"^\\d")) this will remove digits 
5. group_by(word) and summarize or use count()
6. arrange(desc(n)) 
7. create a term_frequency table 
8. finally, print out the the top 20 terms using top_n() or slice_max()


```{r}
excludes <- c("you'll","including","experience","requirements","required","preferred","responsibilities")
term_frequency<-jobs%>%
  unnest_tokens(word,job_description)%>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word" = "word"))%>%
  filter(!word %in% excludes )%>%
  filter(!str_detect(word,"^\\d"))%>%
  count(word,sort = T)
term_frequency%>%
  top_n(20)
```

### Task 1a. 

Create a wordcloud with all of the terms, using wordcloud2()

```{r}
term_frequency%>%
  wordcloud2()
```

### Task 1b. 

Create a wordcloud for the terms that start with the letter "a" 

```{r}
term_frequency%>%
  filter(str_sub(word,1,1)=='a')%>%
  wordcloud2()
```

### Task 1c. 

Create a word cloud of companies 

```{r}
jobs%>%
  count(firm,sort = T)%>%
  wordcloud2()
```


### Task 1d. 

Create a word cloud of job titles. 

```{r}
jobs%>%
  count(title,sort=T)%>%
  wordcloud2()
```



# Task 2, Words after DATA 

Clearly "DATA" an important word so what words come after data? 

------

## Task 2.1 - Words AFTER "data" ... 

1. pipe jobs 
2. into: unnest_tokens(bigram, job_description, token = "ngrams", n = 2, n_min = 2), what does bigram do?
3. separate bigram into two words: separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ")
4. filter for "data" filter(word1 == "data") 
5. remove junk words on word2, filter(!word2 %in% excludes ) this will remove excluded word
6. unite word 1 and 2 together into a bigram
7. group_by(bigram)
8. summarize(n=n())
9. arrange(desc(n))
10. save data_term_frequency 

11. print top 10 data + terms 

```{r}
data_term_frequency <- jobs%>%
  unnest_tokens(bigram, job_description, token = "ngrams", n = 2, n_min = 2)%>% #bigram is all the sequences of two adjacent elements from strings in 'tittle'
  separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ")%>%
  filter(word1 == "data") %>%
  filter(!word2 %in% excludes )%>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word2" = "word"))%>%
  unite(bigram,word1,word2,sep=" ")%>%
  group_by(bigram)%>%
  summarise(n=n())%>%
  arrange(desc(n))

head(data_term_frequency,10)

  
```

## Task 2.2 - Create a word cloud of data + term combinations

```{r}
data_term_frequency%>%
  wordcloud2()
```

## Task 2.3 - Create a bar chart of the top 15, data + term combinations

```{r}
data_term_frequency%>%
  top_n(15,n)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(bigram,n),y=n))+
  geom_bar(stat='identity')+
  coord_flip()
```

# Task 3, Technology Term Analysis

technology_term_frequency <- tech_bigram_freq%>%
  bind_rows(tech_term_freq)%>%
  arrange(-n)
technology_term_frequency
  
```

### Task 3a. Make a Bar Chart of Technolgy Terms

# Task 4. Your Resume 

---------

## Task 4 - getting started 

1. save/print your resume as PDF, it needs to be PDF format for this to work.  
2. install pdftools and load the library(pdftools)
3. use pdf_text to read your resume into a table. for example here's how i read my resume:  

resume <- pdf_text("/Users/mikames/Downloads/Michael Ames Resume_CurrentJan2019.pdf")
  
> note: this makes a character vector of your resume, we need to tidy it up and get it into a table. 

```{r}
library(pdftools)
resume <- pdf_text("QiweiShen_resume_202107.pdf")
```
  
## Task 4.2 - Parse your resume, filter out the common words, digits, and any excludes 
Your resume is now a character vector, you'll need to perform the following 
1. as_tibble(resume) will convert it to a data frame 
2. parse text into words, using unnest_tokens(word, value)
3. remove words you want to exclude 
4. remove numbers
5. group by words and count the words up. to make a resume_word_freq table.  

```{r}
excludes=c(str_to_lower(month.name),
           "china","shanghai","canada","apac","nc","school","university","fudan"
                )
resume_word_freq<-resume%>%
  as_tibble(resume)%>%
  unnest_tokens(word,value)%>%
  anti_join(stop_words)%>%
  filter(!word %in% excludes )%>%
  filter(!str_detect(word,"^\\d"))%>%
  count(word,sort=T)
resume_word_freq
```

## Task 4.3 - Create a word cloud of the remaining words in your resume

```{r}
wordcloud2(resume_word_freq)
```

## Task 4.4 filter for technology_words and technology_bigrams 

to do this you'll need to Bigram Freq. your resume, hen filter for technology_bigrams 

###  Task 4.4 Steps: Bigram Freq. your resume, filter for technology_bigrams  

1. as_tibble(resume) pipe into 
2. unnest_tokens(word, value, token = "ngrams", n = 2, n_min = 2) to make bigrams 
3. filter(word %in% technology_bigram ) for specific bigrams 
4. group_by(word) 
5. summarize(n=n()) 
6.  arrange(desc(n)) 
7.  make a resume_bigram_freq


```{r}
resume_bigram_freq<-as_tibble(resume)%>%
  unnest_tokens(word, value, token = "ngrams", n = 2, n_min = 2)%>%
  filter(word %in% technology_bigram )%>%
  group_by(word)%>%
  summarize(n=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) 
resume_bigram_freq
  
```

### 4.4 finally SMASH resume_word_freq & resume_bigram_freq together 

1. use bind_rows() to do this. 


```{r}
#tech word in resume
resume_tech_word_freq <- as_tibble(resume)%>%
  unnest_tokens(word, value, token = "words")%>%
  filter(word %in% technology_words )%>%
  group_by(word)%>%
  summarize(n=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) 


#combine words and bigrams
resume_tech_freq <- resume_tech_word_freq%>%
  bind_rows(resume_bigram_freq)
resume_tech_freq

```

### TASK 4.4a - make a bar chart of combined technolgy term frequencies

```{r}
resume_tech_freq%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(word,n),y=n))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  coord_flip()
```


### TASK 4.4b - make a wordcloud of combined technolgy term frequencies

```{r}
resume_tech_freq%>%
  wordcloud2()
```

## Task 5 â€“ Compare resume jobs. 

5.1	What terms do your resume and jobs data have in common? That is, compare your resume's terms to the terms found in the job descriptions. 
```{r}
resume_word_freq%>%
  inner_join(term_frequency,by='word',suffix=c("_resume","_job"))%>%
  arrange(-n_resume)

```

5.2	Based on the job's terms, what terms are missing from your resume? Make a table of terms missing from your resume but found in your job descriptions. 
```{r}
term_frequency%>%
  anti_join(resume_word_freq,by='word')%>%
  arrange(-n)
```

5.3	What tech-skills does your resume and jobs have in common?
```{r}
resume_tech_freq%>%
  inner_join(technology_term_frequency,by=c('word'='term'),suffix =c('_resume','_job') )%>%
  arrange(-n_resume)
```

5.4	Based on the job's tech-skills what skills are missing from your resume? 

```{r}
technology_term_frequency%>%
  anti_join(resume_tech_freq,by=c('term'='word'))%>%
  arrange(-n)
```
